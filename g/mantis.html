    <h1>MANTIS</h1>
    <h2>Modular Admin Network Tools, Integrated System</h2>
    <p>
      MANTIS is an innovative, modular system tailored for network
      administrators seeking a comprehensive yet flexible suite of tools. Built
      to streamline the complexities of network management, MANTIS integrates
      multiple tools into a cohesive, adaptable system that grows with
      administrative needs. Each component in the MANTIS architecture is
      designed as an independent module, making it possible for administrators
      to customize and expand the toolkit to suit their unique environment.
      Whether it's monitoring, reporting, or automation, MANTIS ensures that
      administrators have the flexibility to add, replace, or update tools
      without disrupting the broader system, enabling effortless scaling and
      adaptability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The modular design of MANTIS extends beyond simple functionality, aiming
      to create an ecosystem where each module operates independently while
      communicating seamlessly with others. This architecture allows for high
      customization and provides a dynamic framework that can adapt to new
      challenges as technology advances. By isolating each tool into modules,
      MANTIS empowers administrators to experiment with new functionalities and
      test innovative solutions without compromising core operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      MANTIS also offers an intuitive interface, making complex tasks accessible
      for administrators of all experience levels. The system was crafted to be
      not only powerful but user-friendly, ensuring that administrators can
      leverage all capabilities without unnecessary learning curves. The
      interface includes various customization options, from detailed dashboards
      to real-time notifications, giving administrators instant insights into
      network health and performance. This commitment to user-centric design
      makes MANTIS a truly versatile solution for small to enterprise-level
      network operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency and Data Policy</h2>
    <p>
      At the heart of MANTIS is a commitment to transparency and responsible
      data management. By participating on the Inky SMP server, players
      acknowledge and agree to the logging of gameplay data, which is utilized
      solely to maintain the integrity and efficiency of server operations. All
      data collected is securely stored and safeguarded against any unauthorized
      access, aligning with MANTISâ€™s core mission to protect user privacy and
      data security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, all information documented by MANTIS is ultimately public
      data, available to server participants for review. This transparency is
      designed to foster trust and accountability between administrators and
      players, ensuring that any actions taken on the server are transparent and
      compliant with ethical guidelines. MANTIS automates data documentation,
      making access to relevant information more efficient for both players and
      administrators, while adhering to privacy standards and best practices.
