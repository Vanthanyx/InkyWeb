        <h3>Orgins Mod</h3>
        <p>
          The Origins Mod is a mod that allows players to choose from a variety
          of different origins. Each origin has its own unique abilities and
          playstyle, providing a fresh and exciting experience for players. View
          the
          <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki">wiki</a> for
          more information on the different origins and their abilities. Choose
          an Origin and begin your game with special abilities, some of which
          help you out, while others hinder you in your gameplay. The different
          Origins all have a different impact on the vanilla gameplay. If you
          don't like these at all, you can also pick the "Human" origin while
          playing with friends on a server.

          A custom coded mod for the Inky SMP server. This mod adds custom items
          and features to the server. It is required to play on the server.
          Additionally this mod contains MANTIS, which is an adminstration tool
          for the developers of the server that helps link the minecraft server
          and all of its players to outside databases and applications. By
          playing on the server you agree to the logging of your data for the
          purpose of server administration.
